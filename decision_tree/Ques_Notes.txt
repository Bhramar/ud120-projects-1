In this project, we will again try to identify the authors in a body of emails, this time using a decision tree. The starter code is in decision_tree/dt_author_id.py.
Once again, you'll do the mini-project on your own computer and enter your answers in the web browser. You can find the instructions for the decision tree mini-project here.

Part 1: Get the Decision Tree Running
Get the decision tree up and running as a classifier, setting min_samples_split=40.  It will probably take a while to train.  What’s the accuracy?

Q.
You found in the SVM mini-project that the parameter tune can significantly speed up the training time of a machine learning algorithm. A general rule is that the parameters can tune the complexity of the algorithm, with more complex algorithms generally running more slowly.

Another way to control the complexity of an algorithm is via the number of features that you use in training/testing. The more features the algorithm has available, the more potential there is for a complex fit. We will explore this in detail in the “Feature Selection” lesson, but you’ll get a sneak preview now.

What's the number of features in your data? (Hint: the data is organized into a numpy array where the number of rows is the number of data points and the number of columns is the number of features; so to extract this number, use a line of code like len(features_train[0]).)

Q. Features : 
no. of Chris training emails: 7936
no. of Sara training emails: 7884
features 3785

----

go into ../tools/email_preprocess.py, and find the line of code that looks like this:

selector = SelectPercentile(f_classif, percentile=10)

Change percentile from 10 to 1, and rerun dt_author_id.py. What’s the number of features now?

Ans: 379

--

What do you think SelectPercentile is doing? Would a large value for percentile lead to a more complex or less complex decision tree, all other things being equal? Note the difference in training time depending on the number of features.

Having fewer features around means there are fewer chances for the decision tree to carve out very specific little spots when finding a decision surface.  These specific little spots (what we'd also call evidence of a high-variance result) indicate a more complex decision-making process.  So having more features doesn't usually mean you have a less complex decision tree.
